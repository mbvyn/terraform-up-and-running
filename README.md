# Terraform Learning Repository
This repository serves as a personal learning space for exploring and practicing Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources. 
Here, you will find a collection of code examples and projects that demonstrate various aspects of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.

## Overview
The Terraform Learning Repository is designed to complement a learning journey with the book "[Terraform Up and Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/terraform-up-and/9781098116736/)" and provide a practical hands-on experience. 
It offers a range of examples and projects that align with the concepts covered in the book, allowing to apply what have been learned and further expand knowledge of Terraform.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my appreciation to the author of "[Terraform Up and Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/terraform-up-and/9781098116736/)" 
for his valuable insights and guidance in learning Terraform. 

His book serves as an excellent resource for mastering the principles and practices of infrastructure as code.
